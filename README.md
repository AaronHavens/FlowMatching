## Flow matching from uniform distribution to a circle.
Based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13443">Guided Flows for Generative Modeling and Decision Making</a>, Q. Zheng, M. Le, N. Shaul, Y. Lipman, A. Grover, R. T. Q. Chen 2023. 


Here we are matching the linear flow: x1-x0 with no guidance.
